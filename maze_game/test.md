I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead. <!-- this is for syntax view-->

<!-- this is for code -->
```python
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```

- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

<!-- below is table -->
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
